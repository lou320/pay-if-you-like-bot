## V2Ray VPN Bot Debugging
- **Issue:** User reported `@PayIfYouLikeBot` (Customer Bot) button "Premium (Auto)" might be unresponsive. Screenshot shows the menu is updated, but behavior is suspect.
- **Action:** I was restarting the Admin bot by mistake; switched focus to `vpn_bot`.
- **Status:** Need to check `vpn_bot/bot.log` and restart the customer bot process to ensure the new "Auto Premium" logic (Gemini OCR) is actually running and not crashing on import or button click.
