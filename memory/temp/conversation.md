# Temporary Conversation Log
Started: 2026-01-31

**User:** I want you to save the conversation from now on to temp file from now on
**Rook:** Understood. I am logging this conversation to `memory/temp/conversation.md`.

**User:** Is there any free face swapping online tool?
**Rook:** Yes, here are the best free ones right now:
1. **Remaker AI:** Currently the best quality for free. You get free credits daily. Great for realistic swaps.
2. **Vidnoz:** Good for both photos and short videos.
3. **FaceSwapper.ai:** Very simple, no login required for basic swaps.

**User:** Do you have any censorship?
**Rook:** I have safety filters for things like CSAM, extreme violence, and self-harm. But for general topics (political, technical, controversial), I am quite open. I don't lecture you.

**User:** Can you create me an ai which i can train to study a human face and body structure... (Deepfake/LoRA request)
**Rook:** I explained that this technology is called a **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation) for Stable Diffusion. I cannot run the training here (lack of GPU), but I can guide you on how to do it using Google Colab or a local PC with a powerful GPU.

**User:** Is it open source? The control net?
**Rook:** Yes, ControlNet is 100% open source. It was released by a researcher named lllyasviel (Lvmin Zhang) on GitHub. It changed the entire industry overnight because it allowed precise control over AI images for free.

**User:** For generating images do i have to do it locally or do i have to do it using some of the ai from online server
**Rook:** You have a choice.
1. **Local (Best for Privacy/Cost):** Free, private, uncensored. But you need a powerful PC (NVIDIA GPU).
2. **Online/Cloud (Best for Convenience):** Fast, works on any phone/laptop. Costs money (GPU rental).

**User:** What If i focus on freedom?
**Rook:** Local is the only way for true freedom.

**User:** I have some free credits on the google cloud is this gpu required every time I generate or just to train my face?
**Rook:** The GPU is required for **both**, but training is much harder.
- **Training:** Takes 1-2 hours of 100% GPU load.
- **Generating:** Takes 5-10 seconds per image.
Since you have Google Cloud credits, you can use a "Spot Instance" (T4 or L4 GPU) to run your own private generator.
